# Machine-learning-applications-for-routing-optimization-in-SDN
Within this repository, you will find my final project file for the course Advanced Data Networks, which was instructed by Dr. Pakravan during the spring of 2022. For this project, I extensively reviewed over 50 research papers concerning the utilization of AI in routing within SDN. Subsequently, I synthesized and incorporated these findings to compose a comprehensive survey paper.
